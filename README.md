Round Robin Scheduler
====================
This scheduler was created by [Bold Compass](http://www.boldcompass.com) as a donation to the [Berean Baptist Church](http://berean-baptist.org) Youth Group to fulfill the unique scheduling requirements for the church's annual 3-on-3 basketball tournament.

## Quick start
[Download the installer](https://boldcompass.github.io/roundrobinscheduler/downloads/setup.exe). The Round Robin Scheduler is installed using Click Once. 

## Features
* Simultaneous round robin tournaments for up to three divisions
* Printable schedule
* Tournament information can be saved to a file
* Spread games across a configurable number of courts
* Seeding calculation for a subsequent single-elimination tournament
* Scorekeeping over WiFi and Internet using mobile devices
* Place teams from more advanced divisions on more preferable courts
* Distribute the teams evenly acoss the preferred courts for their division throughout the course of the tournament
* Equal number of turns getting the ball first (first team listed for the game)
* Ability to stop round robin part way through if it gets too long
* Ability to add aditional rounds if the schedule is too short


## Tips
* To reduce the number of divisions, give one or two divisions only one team
* Games can be navigated with <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd>, and the score editor can be opened by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>
* The official flag of a game can be toggled by pressing the <kbd>F</kbd> key when a game is selected or its score editor is open
* The text displyed to score keepers before entering their access code can be configured in the settings dialog
* The number of courts can be configured in the settings dialog

## Proxy
To allow devices not on the WiFi network to participate in scorekeeping, a PHP proxy script is available in the [boldcompass/roundrobinscheduler-proxy repository](https://github.com/boldcompass/roundrobinscheduler-proxy).
